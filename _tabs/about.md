### **Hi there!**

I’m a computer science student really interested in cybersecurity, especially network & application security, digital forensics, and penetration testing. Currently upskilling with projects, labs, and CTFs, which you can find documented here and on [my blog](https://infophreak.com/author/en1gma/) at [**Infophreak**](https://infophreak.com/). Feel free to reach out if you share my passion for security :)
